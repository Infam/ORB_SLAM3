\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed Open\+CV dynamic matrices to static matrices to speed up the code.
\item Capability to measure running time of the system threads.
\item Compatibility with Open\+CV 4.\+0 (Requires at least Open\+CV 3.\+0)
\item Fixed minor bugs.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item RGB-\/D compatibility, the RGB-\/D examples have been adapted to the new version.
\item Kitti and TUM dataset compatibility, these examples have been adapted to the new version.
\item ROS compatibility, updated the old references in the code to work with this version.
\item Config file parser, the YAML file contains the session configuration, a wrong parametrization may break the execution without any information to solve it.

Initial release. It has these capabilities\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Multiple-\/\+Maps capabilities, it is able to handle multiple maps in the same session and merge them when a common area is detected with a seamless fussion.
\item Inertial sensor, the IMU initialization takes 2 seconds to achieve a scale error less than 5\% and it is reffined in the next 10 seconds until it is around 1\%. Inertial measures are integrated at frame rate to estimate the scale, gravity and velocity in order to improve the visual features detection and make the system robust to temporal occlusions.
\item Fisheye sensor, the fisheye sensors are now fully supported in monocular and stereo.
